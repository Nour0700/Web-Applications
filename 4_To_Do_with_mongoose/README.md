<h2> Description </h2>
<p>This is a simple to do list application that stores the list in mongodb atlas and using Node.js and Express.js on the server side. The links are also dynamic, so if you use you local host as a hosting service each time you add a new word to the route a new entry in the database gets created so you can have multiple to do lists. For example each of the following links with access a different database entry: <br> 
http://localhost:3000/work <br>
http://localhost:3000/house <br> </p>
